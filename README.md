# Introduction

This module is a library for communicating with hackerspace sensors and
switches using MQTT as a transport layer. While it has been written with Tog
Hackerspace in mind, it aims to be more broadly usable for other spaces or
purposes. That said, your mileage may vary, and we make no promises as to
servicability for your project.

Written in Typescript for portability, this library aims to be the go-to module
to use when writing Browser, Node.js, cross-platform Mobile (Ionic), and even
device projects using Espruino, with minimal hassle.

# Getting started
Install the libary to your Nodejs, Ionic, browser or other project:
````bash
npm install --save @tog-hackerspace/sensor
````

# Building as Javascript

# Tests

# Warning: In Active Development
